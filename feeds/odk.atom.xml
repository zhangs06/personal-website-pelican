We took a day trip to the Bandipur forest in
Karnataka where they have done extensive work in forest restoration. One of
their success stories is working with the locals to remove invasive species
such as Lantana from the forest. Junglescapes volunteers and locals carry out
regular line transact surveys to determine the impact of their interventions.
One of the goals for my participation was to see if we can replace the
cumbersone paper forms and handheld GPS devices with a mobile-phone based
survey using ODK. I am sharing my notes on how we setup the survey and mapping
of the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="setting-up-odk"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up ODK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a survey form using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://xlsform.org/"&gt;XLSForm&lt;/a&gt; standard. The
form is quite simple and uses the &lt;em&gt;geopoint&lt;/em&gt; field type to collect the Lat/Lon
of the start and end points of the transact. There is also a repeated field of
type &lt;em&gt;image&lt;/em&gt; to capture pictures along the transact. You can make a copy of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WNuMkJKvmW6xI5-blRqSsKBMb89Sn556PUKk1Ufi010/copy"&gt;this XLSForm spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;
and use it to customize your transact survey. Once the spreadsheet was ready, I
converted it XForm using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opendatakit.org/xiframe/"&gt;online converter&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting XML file was loaded to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/"&gt;ODK
Aggregate&lt;/a&gt;  server running on
AppEngine. Individual Android devices running the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/"&gt;ODK Collect&lt;/a&gt; app were configured to use this server
and forms were downloaded to the devices. You may also skip the server and copy
the XML directly to mobile devices running the ODK Collect App.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" class="align-center" src="/images/line-transact1.png" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="collecting-field-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collecting Field Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon entering the wildlife sanctuary, we trekked up to the region where the
restoration has been done. There were 4 sites where we had to carry out the
line transact survey. We lay down a 150ft line using a tape measure and
collected data about number of trees, shrubs, plants and grass in a 10ft zone
around the line. The data was entered directly in the ODK Collect app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ODK Collect app works completely offline. We were in the middle of a forest
with no cell coverage but data collection work seamlessly. The app would sync
the data once the devices get cell reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" class="align-center" src="/images/line-transact2.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="processing-field-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Processing Field Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we finished the surveys, we headed back from the sanctuary. When our
devices got mobile data signals, the form submissions were submitted to the ODK
Aggregate server automatically. You can also use the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opendatakit.org/use/briefcase/"&gt;ODK Briefcase&lt;/a&gt; application on your computer to copy
the data from devices directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you pull the data from the devices using ODK Aggregate or ODK Briefcase,
you would have a spreadsheet with individual form submissions. This itself can
be a final product of the survey and can be maintained as a record from
periodic surveys. We wanted to also map the data since we had collected GPS
coordinates for the start and end of each transact. This required a little bit
of post-processing of the data to create a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14NWa14J5rzD1jCfGWkip2NuTddDEVWzHisyah2JWRlY/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;spreadsheet like this&lt;/a&gt;.
Saving thie spreadsheet as a CSV, it can be imported in QGIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" class="align-center" src="/images/line-transact3.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;em&gt;Convert points to line&lt;/em&gt; tool from the Processing Toolbox, I created
a line layer from the start and end points of the transact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" class="align-center" src="/images/line-transact4.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting QGIS line layer was exported as a KML and imported to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://google.com/mymaps"&gt;Google My
Maps&lt;/a&gt; . I had also collected our entire trek and
some waypoints using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;My Tracks app&lt;/a&gt;.
This was also imported to Google My Maps. These layers resulted in a rich and
informative map from our field data exercise. See the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zjnvnF630TsQ.kngZHPKOj9HE"&gt;live interactive map&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" class="align-center" src="/images/line-transact5.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, using ODK for the transact surveys helped speed up the data
collection. There was no data-entry after the surveys and creating an
interactive map visualization was a breeze. If you are an individual or a team
who is doing field data collection, moving to ODK would help you reduce errors
and collect accurate data without the hassles of data entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

is a non-profit organization based out of Bangalore, India. Their mission is to
reach out and rehabilitate people with disability from the under privileged
segment. Over the past year, I along with my colleagues have been volunteering
with them to develop a system that can help improve their field data collection
efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;APD provides variety of services rehabilitate under privileged people with
disabilities. Before they can render any service, they need register the
individuals with the organization and collect basic background information.
Registrations are mostly done in their field offices or at camps organized in
rural areas. Paper forms were filled at the site and shipped to their field
office. A staff member entered the data manually into their software platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="a registration camp" src="/images/apd1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;A registration camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has many problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The text on the paper form was often illegible. Some fields were missing or
inaccurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data entry was laborious and introduced errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4–6 weeks of lag time before the data was available in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-solution"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We helped APD implement a process using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opendatakit.org/"&gt;OpenDataKit (ODK)&lt;/a&gt; that allowed capture of the form using android
devices. With the new system, the data is captured on the mobile device using
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;ODK Collect&lt;/a&gt;
app in the field and sent to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/"&gt;ODK Aggregate&lt;/a&gt; server running on Google AppEngine.
The data ends up in a shared spreadsheet which is imported to APD’s system
after each registration camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="APD staff using the ODK collect mobile app" src="/images/apd2.png" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;APD staff using the ODK collect mobile app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new workflow offers several advantages over the paper based forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable data collection in areas with poor network connectivity. ODK Collect
app can work completely offline and the data is stored on the device memory.
Once the staff members are back in office and connect to a WiFi network --
the data is sent to the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mobile app enforces checks, so all the data is consistent and there are
no missing fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows for the capture of pictures and additional metadata (such as time,
location, staff id).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data is exported from the spreadsheet and imported to their system the
next day -- cutting the lag from weeks to hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="timeline"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 2014: Met with the APD registration team to understand their
requirements and design a process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November 2014: A prototype is created by migrating the registration form to
ODK using XLSForm. APD trains field staff on using the mobile app. Successful
field test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="First field test" src="/images/apd3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;First field test of the app with newly trained staff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 2014: First full-fledged camp with 3 devices. Successful
registration of 55 participants. Staff is very happy with the increased
speed, accuracy and reduction in delay in getting the registrations
processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="First real deployment." src="/images/apd4.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;First ‘real’ deployment.Staff had paper forms as backup, but did not need it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 2014: APD moves their registrations completely to mobile devices. All
registrations are completely paperless and have the added benefit of having
participant’s picture as part of the registration process. Over 500
registrations processed without a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="paperless registration camp" src="/images/apd5.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Completely paperless registration camp after migration to the mobile app&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a great start, we are looking at helping them with other
challenges in the field. In the coming months, we want to tackle the following
problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrate patient visit and treatment forms to OpenDataKit. These require
having access to the patient’s medical history in the field. OpenDataKit’s
2.0 suite of tools would be a good fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task allocation and scheduling optimization for the field staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encoding the knowledge from the training manual to a mobile app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
