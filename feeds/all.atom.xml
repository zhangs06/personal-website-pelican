latitude/longitude coordinate pairs. There are many options available if you
want to import these in a GIS and run analysis. But there is a simpler and much
more accesible way if you aren't doing very high accuracy calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to write a simple &lt;em&gt;Macro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;AppScript&lt;/em&gt; for Google Spreadsheets,
which uses the well-known &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula"&gt;Haversine formula&lt;/a&gt; to calculate distance
between 2 coordinates. Once the script is saved, the user of the spreadsheet
can use the function 'distance()' just the way one uses any of the built-in
functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="forumla to calculate distance." src="/images/calculate-distance-spreadsheet.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can give it a try. Just open &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkXc7QoGul60dEc5Q01pTGNfa3N5YW5EWDNkOG9Ec3c&amp;amp;newcopy=true"&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;,
make a copy it and play with it as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

Hyderabad. This was a surprisingly low-profile event and there was very little
buzz about it on the internet. I learnt about it just in time to register and
make it to the event. Here I am sharing some notes and impressions. (notes are
mostly from memory, so please excuse if I missed something)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven’t been  to other FOSS4G events, but this was unlike any other Geo
conference I have attended.  It was very formal and  government-centric. All
presentations were from government researchers, employees or students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The penetration of open-source software within government was deeper than I
anticipated and the decision-makers - including the politicians recognize the
benefits of using open technologies. The Chief Guest - Shri V. Aruna Kumar,
MP from Rajahmundry district commented that he realizes that the real cost of
software is not the upfront cost, but the lifetime maintenance cost and
open-source and open-standards can really benefit in the longer run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keynote’s main message was that we should really focus on delivering
applications that solve real problems. According to the speaker - Shri Anoop
Singh, Special Secretary to AP Government - we have not even begun to realize
the full potential of GIS within governments. For most end-users and decision
makers, the ‘Science’ or 'System' in GIS isn’t important and GIS should
really be about Geographic Information Services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India is seen largely as a follower in the open source movement and no big
open-source projects have come out of research institutions here. To address
this, International Institute of Information Technology released one of their
projects - LSIViewer as open-source. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LSI-IIIT/lsiviewer"&gt;github upload&lt;/a&gt; was done during the
inauguration of the conference by the chief guest!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prof. Venkatesh Raghavan receiving 2012 &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.osgeo.org/solkatz"&gt;Sol Katz award&lt;/a&gt; Prof. Venkatesh Raghavan, Osaka City
University was chosen as the winner of the 2012 Sol Katz ward by OsGeo. The
award was given to him during the conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postgrasql + PostGIS, Geoserver and Openlayers seem to be the platform of
choice. Almost all applications I saw were built  using one of these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ELOGeo portal was shown an example of learning resources available for open
source geo tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is virtually no  open data for India given the strict geo data policy.
But even within the government departments - there is a lot of reluctance in
data sharing. Everyone talked about this problem of data being guarded very
closely and seldom shared. But some forward thinking departments, especially
in Tamil Nadu, have found a way around it by promoting Web Services. They
publish a WMS feed for the datasets. That way other departments can use the
data without really having any ownership of it. This seems to be working
well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ms. Mahalakshmi from National Informatics Center (NIC) in Tamil Nadu
demonstrated some of most interesting internal applications built by them.
They have built web services for different departments and each department
uses these web services for their application. Administrative boundaries,
census data, land use maps, land parcels, police data and planning related
data are some examples which are available via WMS. She also showed a pretty
cool app that BSNL - Chennai uses to identify fault points in their 2G
network. The map is updated in real-time with pings from their different 2G
sites around Chennai.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/bhuvan/"&gt;BHUVAN&lt;/a&gt; - Indian Space Research
Organization’s (ISRO) portal for disseminating geodata has come a long way
since it’s launch a few years back. It’s built completely using open-source
stack and it’s a pretty snappy app. For the first time, a lot of thematic
datasets are available freely to the public via WMS.  They are also making
some medium and low resolution raw/derived data from Indian remote sensing
satellites available for download. The downloads are for personal use only,
but this is a big step forward in India’s data access policy which has been
very restrictive so far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, some positives and challenges for Open-source software described by
various speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-open-source-is-very-attractive-to-governments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why open source is very attractive to governments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No upfront cost. Don’t have to navigate complicated and time-consuming
approval and procurement process. Easy to get started at low-cost and do a
proof-of-concept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standards Compliant. Rising awareness within the government of being
standards compliant. Choosing a proprietary solution which is not standards
compliant can cause problems and raise questions from others in future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No vendor lock-in. Can hire another consultant to run or develop services
since all code is available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="challenges-to-wider-open-source-adoption"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges to wider open source adoption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of support. Not many companies providing development and support. Most
applications shown were written and maintained by in-house staff. Big
opportunities for consultants who can provide support for open source tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change aversion: On the desktop, most people are used to proprietary software
from their education or prior work. One example given was reluctance in the
government to switch to Open Office. Free versions of MS Office is easy to
come by and no incentive to learn and adopt open source solution. Using
open-source software in education is a way to increase the adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack  of Mature solutions: Politicians and administrators felt they had
limited time in their tenure to implement whatever changes they want and show
progress.  There is always the attraction to choose a well known solution and
get the results. The key message was that they feel the open-source software
is mature but there are no mature solutions based on these that the
governments can adopt without much risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It was wonderful
to be among geogeeks and see the energy and enthusiasm. Got to see some great
demos and LBS apps from startups in India. Here's a run down from my notes and
bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic cams in Bangalore: This was probably the coolest demo for me. Love
the simplicity and usefulness. Just open this URL in your smartphone browser
and get real-time feed from the traffic-cam neareast to you from BTIS.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackday.freecrow.org/trafficam"&gt;http://hackday.freecrow.org/trafficam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thru the Gall: A Layar-based android app to solve the last-mile direcction
problem in India. Bubbles guide you through the narrow-lanes (galli).
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.layar.com/layers/galli/"&gt;http://www.layar.com/layers/galli/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Padma: Search and Browse Indian documentaries through locations of the clips
in the documentaries &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pad.ma/map"&gt;http://pad.ma/map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DelightCircle: LBS app to discover offers and discounts near you. Surprised
at the coverage and partnerships they are able to genrate in the short time.
Powered by MongoDB at the backend.http://delightcircle.com/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commonfloor.com: Google Maps API app for property search. Nicely done and
simple UI and fast lad times. The team talked about challenges and techniques
they use to de-dup the listings and pin the individual listings to the
apartment block. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.commonfloor.com/apartments-for-sale/maps/"&gt;http://www.commonfloor.com/apartments-for-sale/maps/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo: I had forgotten about yahoo as a geo player. But from the talk the
team seems pretty excited about their geo APIs. The Geo APIs are used by many
yahoo properties internally and available to developers too. The API to
extract locations from free-form-text was cool. YQL is a SQL-like query
interface for their API. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/"&gt;http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/&lt;/a&gt;,  APIS at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/"&gt;http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NextDrop: Very interesting idea. Most places in India do not have a regular
water supply and people's day revolves around when they are able to collecct
water. They have built a system that alerts subscribers by sms when they can
expect water based on the information from the utility company. Subscribers
pay Rs.10/month to get this data. Their challenge revoled around locating
their customers on a map - both for billing as well as determining which
pipeline will supply them water. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nextdrop.org"&gt;http://nextdrop.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lokasi: Simple android app that allows you to share your current location by
sms. Reverse-geocoding + location identifier. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.onze.in/"&gt;http://www.onze.in/&lt;/a&gt;  .
collected POIs + street geometry for entire bangalore is about 6 months with
a 10-person team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brief history of map making: Fun talk with lot of pretty and interesting
maps.  No geo conference is complete without a passionate discussion on
projections :)

their Thesis. I have debated this myself when I was a student. The ideal topic
would be the one that allows you to dive into a topic deeply as well as give
you some practical skills that will help you landing a job. Here are some
pointer that may help you make that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="create-a-mashup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a Mashup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mashup is created by merging 2 or more sources of location data. There are
variety of free data available for you to experiment with and create unique
applications. Map mashups can be created using free tools such as Google Maps,
OpenLayers, GeoCommons Maker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="develop-a-plug-in-for-an-open-source-gis"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Develop a plug-in for an open-source GIS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always a need to implement new features for open-source GIS software
like QGIS or MapWindowGIS. You can implement a cool feature or customize the
software for a particular domain. You will not only gain valuable experience
developing among the best programmers but also this will be an impressive
addition to your resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="work-with-an-ngo"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work with an NGO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most often students struggle to find good quality free GIS data which can be
used in interesting ways. Contact local NGOs to see if you can help them
analyze their location-specific data. Most NGOs collect some form of loation
data and your GIS skills can come in handy to them. The result of such a
project could be a unique GIS project that uses real on-the-ground data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="build-a-campus-gis"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build a Campus GIS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are at a university, a good project would be to put together a
web-accessible campus information system. You could model the campus buildings
in 3D, use satellite imagery via an API and overlay data about your campus.
Such a system could be attractive to the administrator as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="develop-a-vehicle-tracking-system"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Develop a vehicle tracking system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy a cheap GPS receiver and implement a vehicle tracking system. This
will get you exposed to GPS/GSM protocols and get you hands-on knowledge that
many companies worldwide are looking for. Add your own twist to the traditional
tracking system by specializing it for walking directions, bus travel, toursut
sightseeing, navigating the blind etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="do-some-green-research"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do some 'Green' research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is turning to green and sustainable technologies. As an intern or a
researcher, you could use your analytical skills to further the knowledge in
this area. Wind power, solar energy, climate change etc. are great topics for
GIS and Remote Sensing research.Analysing wind data to find best locations for
wind turbines or using remote sensing images to detect climate change are some
examples of projects. If you are a PhD student, you'll find these topics
complex and challenging enough for yor dissertation and you'll stand to recieve
grants or funds from governments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have more ideas to share? What project are you thinking of? Please leave
a comment and help the GIS student community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
