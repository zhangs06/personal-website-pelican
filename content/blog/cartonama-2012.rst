I was at #cartonama conference in Bangalore on 23rd September. It was wonderful
to be among geogeeks and see the energy and enthusiasm. Got to see some great
demos and LBS apps from startups in India. Here's a run down from my notes and
bookmarks.


* Traffic cams in Bangalore: This was probably the coolest demo for me. Love
  the simplicity and usefulness. Just open this URL in your smartphone browser
  and get real-time feed from the traffic-cam neareast to you from BTIS.

* Thru the Gall: A Layar-based android app to solve the last-mile direcction
  problem in India. Bubbles guide you through the narrow-lanes (galli).

* Padma: Search and Browse Indian documentaries through locations of the clips
  in the documentaries http://pad.ma/map

* DelightCircle: LBS app to discover offers and discounts near you. Surprised
  at the coverage and partnerships they are able to genrate in the short time.
  Powered by MongoDB at the backend.http://delightcircle.com/

* Commonfloor.com: Google Maps API app for property search. Nicely done and
  simple UI and fast lad times. The team talked about challenges and techniques
  they use to de-dup the listings and pin the individual listings to the
  apartment block. http://www.commonfloor.com/apartments-for-sale/maps/

* Yahoo: I had forgotten about yahoo as a geo player. But from the talk the
  team seems pretty excited about their geo APIs. The Geo APIs are used by many
  yahoo properties internally and available to developers too. The API to
  extract locations from free-form-text was cool. YQL is a SQL-like query
  interface for their API. http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/,  APIS at
  http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/

* NextDrop: Very interesting idea. Most places in India do not have a regular
  water supply and people's day revolves around when they are able to collecct
  water. They have built a system that alerts subscribers by sms when they can
  expect water based on the information from the utility company. Subscribers
  pay Rs.10/month to get this data. Their challenge revoled around locating
  their customers on a map - both for billing as well as determining which
  pipeline will supply them water. http://nextdrop.org

* Lokasi: Simple android app that allows you to share your current location by
  sms. Reverse-geocoding + location identifier. http://www.onze.in/  .
  collected POIs + street geometry for entire bangalore is about 6 months with
  a 10-person team.

* Brief history of map making: Fun talk with lot of pretty and interesting
  maps.  No geo conference is complete without a passionate discussion on
  projections :)

* Chalo BEST: Bus route planner for Mumbai using OpenTripPlanner and GTFS feed
  from BEST. http://trip.chalobest.in/ . Challenges in converting messy
  spreadsheet data from the agengy in to GTFS feed.

* Geohash: overview of the geohash system. Lots of discussion around what
  geohash is good for. http://geohash.org/
