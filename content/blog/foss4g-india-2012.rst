India’s first FOSS4G - India conference was organized on 25-26 October, 2012 at
Hyderabad. This was a surprisingly low-profile event and there was very little
buzz about it on the internet. I learnt about it just in time to register and
make it to the event. Here I am sharing some notes and impressions. (notes are
mostly from memory, so please excuse if I missed something)


- I haven’t been  to other FOSS4G events, but this was unlike any other Geo
  conference I have attended.  It was very formal and  government-centric. All
  presentations were from government researchers, employees or students.

- The penetration of open-source software within government was deeper than I
  anticipated and the decision-makers - including the politicians recognize the
  benefits of using open technologies. The Chief Guest - Shri V. Aruna Kumar,
  MP from Rajahmundry district commented that he realizes that the real cost of
  software is not the upfront cost, but the lifetime maintenance cost and
  open-source and open-standards can really benefit in the longer run.

- Keynote’s main message was that we should really focus on delivering
  applications that solve real problems. According to the speaker - Shri Anoop
  Singh, Special Secretary to AP Government - we have not even begun to realize
  the full potential of GIS within governments. For most end-users and decision
  makers, the ‘Science’ or 'System' in GIS isn’t important and GIS should
  really be about Geographic Information Services.

- India is seen largely as a follower in the open source movement and no big
  open-source projects have come out of research institutions here. To address
  this, International Institute of Information Technology released one of their
  projects - LSIViewer as open-source. The `github upload
  <https://github.com/LSI-IIIT/lsiviewer>`_ was done during the
  inauguration of the conference by the chief guest!

- Prof. Venkatesh Raghavan receiving 2012 `Sol Katz award
  <http://www.osgeo.org/solkatz>`_ Prof. Venkatesh Raghavan, Osaka City
  University was chosen as the winner of the 2012 Sol Katz ward by OsGeo. The
  award was given to him during the conference.

- Postgrasql + PostGIS, Geoserver and Openlayers seem to be the platform of
  choice. Almost all applications I saw were built  using one of these.

- ELOGeo portal was shown an example of learning resources available for open
  source geo tools.

- There is virtually no  open data for India given the strict geo data policy.
  But even within the government departments - there is a lot of reluctance in
  data sharing. Everyone talked about this problem of data being guarded very
  closely and seldom shared. But some forward thinking departments, especially
  in Tamil Nadu, have found a way around it by promoting Web Services. They
  publish a WMS feed for the datasets. That way other departments can use the
  data without really having any ownership of it. This seems to be working
  well.

- Ms. Mahalakshmi from National Informatics Center (NIC) in Tamil Nadu
  demonstrated some of most interesting internal applications built by them.
  They have built web services for different departments and each department
  uses these web services for their application. Administrative boundaries,
  census data, land use maps, land parcels, police data and planning related
  data are some examples which are available via WMS. She also showed a pretty
  cool app that BSNL - Chennai uses to identify fault points in their 2G
  network. The map is updated in real-time with pings from their different 2G
  sites around Chennai.

- `BHUVAN <http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/bhuvan/>`_ - Indian Space Research
  Organization’s (ISRO) portal for disseminating geodata has come a long way
  since it’s launch a few years back. It’s built completely using open-source
  stack and it’s a pretty snappy app. For the first time, a lot of thematic
  datasets are available freely to the public via WMS.  They are also making
  some medium and low resolution raw/derived data from Indian remote sensing
  satellites available for download. The downloads are for personal use only,
  but this is a big step forward in India’s data access policy which has been
  very restrictive so far.

In summary, some positives and challenges for Open-source software described by
various speakers.

Why open source is very attractive to governments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- No upfront cost. Don’t have to navigate complicated and time-consuming
  approval and procurement process. Easy to get started at low-cost and do a
  proof-of-concept.

- Standards Compliant. Rising awareness within the government of being
  standards compliant. Choosing a proprietary solution which is not standards
  compliant can cause problems and raise questions from others in future.

- No vendor lock-in. Can hire another consultant to run or develop services
  since all code is available.

Challenges to wider open source adoption
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Lack of support. Not many companies providing development and support. Most
  applications shown were written and maintained by in-house staff. Big
  opportunities for consultants who can provide support for open source tools.

- Change aversion: On the desktop, most people are used to proprietary software
  from their education or prior work. One example given was reluctance in the
  government to switch to Open Office. Free versions of MS Office is easy to
  come by and no incentive to learn and adopt open source solution. Using
  open-source software in education is a way to increase the adoption.

- Lack  of Mature solutions: Politicians and administrators felt they had
  limited time in their tenure to implement whatever changes they want and show
  progress.  There is always the attraction to choose a well known solution and
  get the results. The key message was that they feel the open-source software
  is mature but there are no mature solutions based on these that the
  governments can adopt without much risk.
