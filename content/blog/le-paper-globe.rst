A long pending weekend project is done. Printed, cut and folded a sturdy globe
using the template from `Le Paper Globe <http://joachimesque.com/globe/>`_.

This is not only fun, but a good prop to learn more about Geography. I envision
it would make a fun do-it-yourself project with kids of all ages.
