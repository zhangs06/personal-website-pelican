This is my personal website describing some of my work. I am passionate about
teaching and open source software. My work with the community has been mostly
around `QGIS </qgis>`_ and `OpenDataKit </opendatakit>`_. I also maintain some
`directory websites </websites>`_ with free resources for the geospatial
industry in India.

I am currently located in Bangalore, India and work as a Tech Lead/Manager for
the aerial imagery team at Google.
