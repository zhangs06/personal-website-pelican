Mobile Field Data Collection using OpenDataKit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Center for Ecological Studies, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.*

Gave an overview of the OpenDataKit (ODK) toolset and did some hands-on form authoring using
XLSForm. Loading the form on to the ODK collect android app, we did a short
field exercise to do a tree survey around the campus.
